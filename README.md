# FinAlly — AI Trading Workstation

A visually stunning AI-powered trading workstation that streams live market data, simulates portfolio trading, and integrates an LLM chat assistant that can analyze positions and execute trades via natural language.

Built entirely by coding agents as a capstone project for an agentic AI coding course. See [planning/PLAN.md](planning/PLAN.md) for the full specification.

## Features

- **Live price streaming** via SSE with green/red flash animations
- **Simulated portfolio** — $10k virtual cash, market orders, instant fills
- **Portfolio visualizations** — heatmap (treemap), P&L chart, positions table
- **AI chat assistant** — analyzes holdings, suggests and auto-executes trades
- **Watchlist management** — track tickers manually or via AI
- **Dark terminal aesthetic** — Bloomberg-inspired, data-dense layout

## Architecture

Single Docker container serving everything on port 8000:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (static export) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python/uv) with SSE streaming
- **Database**: SQLite with lazy initialization
- **AI**: LiteLLM → OpenRouter (Cerebras inference) with structured outputs
- **Market data**: Built-in GBM simulator (default) or Massive API (optional)

## Status

The market data subsystem (simulator, cache, SSE streaming) is built and tested in `backend/`. Frontend, portfolio, chat, and Docker packaging are not yet implemented — see [planning/MARKET_DATA_SUMMARY.md](planning/MARKET_DATA_SUMMARY.md) for what's done.

## Development

```bash
cd backend
uv sync --extra dev
uv run --extra dev pytest -v            # Run tests
uv run market_data_demo.py              # Live terminal price demo
```

See [backend/CLAUDE.md](backend/CLAUDE.md) for the backend API details.
